**Adopt a network source of truth and a data-driven approach to networking**

## What is this book about?
This book will help you understand why a network source of truth is needed for long-term network automation success, which will in turn save you hundreds of hours in deploying and integrating Nautobot into network automation.

This book covers the following exciting features:
* Understand network sources of truth and the role they play in network automation architecture
* Gain an understanding of Nautobot as a network source and a network automation platform
* Convert Python scripts to enable self-service Nautobot Jobs
* Understand how YAML files in Git can be easily integrated into Nautobot
* Get to grips with the NetDevOps ecosystem around Nautobot and its app ecosystem
* Delve into popular Nautobot Apps including Single Source of Truth and Golden Config

## Instructions and Navigations
All of the code is organized into folders. For example, chapter-03.

The code will look like the following:
```
devices_url = "https://demo.nautobot.com/api/dcim/devices/"
# adds ams01-leaf-11 to the location AMS01
r = session.post(devices_url, data=json.dumps(payload))
# the UUID of the device will be saved for the next API call
device_id = r.json()["id"]
```

**Following is what you need for this book:**
This book is for network engineers, network automation engineers, and software engineers looking to support their network teams by building custom Nautobot Apps. A basic understanding of networking (e.g. CCNA) and knowledge of the fundamentals of Linux, Python programming, Jinja2, YAML, and JSON are needed to get the most out of this book.

With the following software and hardware list you can run all code files present in the book (Chapter 1-16).
